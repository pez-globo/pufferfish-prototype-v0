Before running the program
- you need to make sure you have Arduino Due support in your IDE - follow instructions on https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoDue
- you need to add the libraries (sfm3x00 and Honeywell_TruStability_SPI) - follow instructions on https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries (Importing a .zip Library)
- make sure you use the native USB port (for both programming and running the Arduino): https://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Guide/DueSerialPorts.jpg
